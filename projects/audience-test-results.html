    <h2>Audience Test Results</h2>

    <p>Users did not go through the entire front page and jumped to the external link or the map. In both cases they only came back to the narrative after they had finished interacting with the map.</p>
    <p>In one case, one of the testers thought the AIGA link was our site and interacted with that for the majority of their time testing. I found that while it was disheartening at first that we had put in so much time to make graphics for the site, animate them, and also implement a one page scroll, it made a lot of sense. Audience testing was extremely helpful in making me realize that there are different users. While we couldn’t necessarily throw out everything we worked on just based on two testers, it says a lot when both had very similar user flows.</p>
      <p>My goal was to either reword the links, switch up the interfaces for the links, or rethink the narrative. In the end, I thought the entire narrative needed to be rethought out in order to grab the attention of users more effectively. In ‘DMMT’, one of the things I learned was that if your user doesn’t get to the main point of your site within a few clicks, they leave. In my end, they end had to scroll to get the entire point, and that’s already too much for some people.
      The first comment one of the testers had after 5 minutes of interaction was “there are too many words.”
