    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>What intrigued me with design is that it has the power to change the world. Design is not just about aesthetic pleasure, it can be redesigned to help people.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>Confidence in my designs and lack of time to execute passion projects.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>As a first-generation Latina, I feel like I have been exposed to a lot of different obstacles in college, but those experiences have helped me become a more well-rounded person. The design industry can be competitive, but my experiences and background as sources of inspiration be have helped guide me with design-related problems.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>Because of underrepresentation, a lot of things in society were made by people not of color, and don't necessarily accommodate the needs to others. With design, they can be redesigned be more inclusive.</p>
