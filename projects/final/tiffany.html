    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>Exhibition design is interdisciplinary by nature. I was drawn by the fact that there are so many factors to consider and you get to communicate ideas through ‘moods’ in environments.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>Knowing my value as a designer fresh in the industry. Speaking out my creative opinions and also valuing my work financially.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>I’m lucky to work in a liberal open-minded environment. However, I did realize it matters to have diversity in employees whether racially or in age. My racial background didn’t drive my design decisions; however, it did encourage me to share my culture with coworkers.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>Come to them! Listen to what they have to say! One meeting and one style (i.e townhall, survey) of allowing  under represented communities is not enough. You have to work and be creative in how to make unheard voices be heard. </p>
