<h3> General Profile </h3>
<img class ="img-circle" src="../images/mako.jpg" alt="mako" title="https://www.facebook.com/luhanatic" width="30%">
  <b>Name:</b> Mako<br>
  <b>Job Title:</b> Student<br>
  <b>Age:</b> 18<br>
  <b>Gender:</b> Female<br>
  <b>Salary:</b> N/A<br>
  <b>Location:</b> Suburban<br>
  <b>Education:</b> Senior in high school, undecided major<br>
  <b>Family:</b> older sister in working field, single parent<br>

  <h4>Goals and Challenges</h4>
  <p>Mako feels the need to make a difference. After growing up in a household
  with only one parent, and seeing the struggles that follow, she knows that
choosing a major and a career path that's financially stable will help her get
by in life more easily. She looks up to her older sister who has successfully done
this as a prosecutor, and wonders if she should follow suit.</p>
<p>However, she has a huge interest in the arts and likes to code very lightly
  in HTML and CSS in her free time. She's been told by her peers and her family
  alike that being a 'graphic designer' or 'web designer' will not make her much
  money at all. She's considering going into community college to take some classes
  in her free time to decide if she really likes it or not, but her family is
  pushing her to take the scholarships and grants she was offered when accepted
  into a university in her area and declare a major in a STEM field.</p>
  <p>Thus far, she thinks that the realm of design is only limited to graphic
    and the web.</p>

  <h4>Values and Fears</h4>
  <p>Mako values family, and has a close-knit relationship with her parent and her
  sister, thus she values their opinion very heavily. She values education, and
understand there's a direct correlation between doing well in school and getting a job.
Unfortunately, with the state of the government, she also understands that just
going to university doesn't guarantee her a job anymore. She also has no interest
in anything really outside of her hobbies in art, and has no real desire to go
into these fields except to make her family happy. </p>
<p>She fears that she'll end up
getting a 9-5 job and eventually burn out, regret and go back to school anyways.</p>
