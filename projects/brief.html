    <h2>Project Brief</h2>

    <h4>Topic Summary</h4>
    <p>The goal of this project is to create an interactive platfom that both describes and informs on some of the disciplines in Design, as well as one or two key POC or varying ethnic designers in that field and the work they have done. Additionally, there
      will be a resources section with projects like the "Good for POC" platform and the like.</p>

    <h4>Target audience description</h4>
    <p>The target audience will be to inform designers, or prospective designers of the field and how ethnically diverse the field is, as seen by both variety of disciplines available, and also how impactful it can be as a vehicle for social change and in
      tech.
    </p>

    <h4>The goals of the project</h4>
    <p>Ideally, this project will be expanded greatly upon outside of just what I am capable of implementing with HTML/CSS/Javascript. For example, I can't particularly showcase the capabilities of Python on the web, or mobile apps using my own knowledge,
      so those sections will probably be omitted from the project since I'd like to be true to its form. Eventually, this could grow into a collaboration with others that can help with providing the workflow of how a mobile app. For now, I'd like to shed
      as much light as possible on POC designers and the work that they do, and also put out resources like "Good for POC" and other platforms that bolster the diverse communities in design.
    </p>
    <h4>Goals for overall look</h4>
    <p>The project will be mostly interactive via a 'next' or 'previous' button that will work to navigate through the many fields of design. In each section, there will be a very short description of the discipline (with a link to read more) as well as
      a demonstration of the behavior of a project (executed through javascript, created by me,) or an example of work done in that field shown in an image.</p>
    <p>For example, if the section is on User Experience, there will be a snippet of code accompanying what the behavior might be like on the front end.
