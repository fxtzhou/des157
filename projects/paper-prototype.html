    <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>

    <p>I learned a lot from paper prototyping because I had almost no idea how I was going to operate the flow of my website. In the first round of iteration, I think my biggest issue was trying to give some ability to bypass the landing interactivity for
      users operating the website a second time. I received feedback that was useful, basically allowing for a previous, next, and reset button. I was also informed that my message may have seemed a little unclear in the beginning and the feedback I received
      on how to succinctly define the project helped me get on track with my project. I will definitely take everything I learned in paper prototyping forward to wireframing and what not. </p>

    <p>I'm also happy to know that the hardest part of the project will probably only be the landing interactive, and everything following that should be fairly easy.</p>
