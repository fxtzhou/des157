  <h2>Comparative Research</h2>

<h4>Abstract: </h4>
<p>I'm tackling diversity in design head-on it seems. I believe there
  are roots in design that we owe to people of color and I want to add to some
  of the platforms out there that highlight and assist POC. Some of the sites I
  found were pretty broad, like the <a href="https://http://designcensus2016.aiga.org/">
    Design Census of 2016</a>, while others are pretty straightforward that it's
    a platform by POC for POC.</p>

    <h4> The Ethnic Filter </h4>
    <img src="../images/ethnic-filter.jpg" alt="ethnic-filter" width="45%" height="45%">
    <p>Utilizing data visulization, <a href="https://studioijeoma.com/">Ekene Ijeoma</a>
    created a site that utilizes webcam blur filter to show the lack of diversity
    in design. 'White' has the highest visibility, followed by Hispanic, Asian,
    and finally, Black. With the click of your mouse, the filter will change from
    clear to blurry depending on the visibility of the ethnicity it's on. In terms
    of interaction, it's very straightforward once you've authorized the site to
    access your webcam. The message is also very robust, though since I found it
    in tandem with the Design Census done by AIGA, I had context as to what it meant.
    At the end of the visibility journey, the site saves a gif of the visibility
    transition and you can share it with others. The overall experience is a compelling
    one, and interactivity is high, although it's not a site you can spend a lot of
    time on. Regardless, the Ethnic Filter allowed me to look into some of Ekene
    Ijeoma's work, which allowed me to hone in on my topic moreso.

  <h4>Good for POC</h4>
<img src="../images/goodforpoc2.jpg" alt="goodforpoc2" width="50%" height="50%">
  <p>I found an article on <a href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/graphic-design/timothy-goodman-on-white-privilege-in-graphic-design-how-we-can-increase-diversity/">
    Timothy Goodman</a>, and he's doing some great things for POC alongside his
    friend <a href="http://amelie.is/">Amelie Lamont</a>, who I looked into a
    little bit more. Turns out she's come up with some great initiatives in
    helping out POC, specifically with her platform <a href="http://goodforpocin.tech/">
      Good for POC</a>, which includes a list of companies that are 'inclusive
      and safe' for POC in the STEAM industries. Very straightforwared site with links to the companies
      like Dropbox and Evernote.  While it doesn't seem like much, just the
      platform itself gave me some ideas as to where I'd like to go with my research.
      The usability is good, and it mirrors a safe space on ther internet much like some
      in reality. When you click on the company, instead of directing you to their
      site and throwing you in to doing research yourself, there's actually a fairly
      descriptive rundown of the company detailing how you know it's safe and inclusive, along
      with some facts about benefits and perks. In fact,
      I found that these companies are the ones that have submitted themselves on the site
      and research was done by Good for POC to ensure that they meet the criteria.
      The hiring process and where to apply is located near the end of the description.
      The content is easy to use, straightforward, and it sends a great message.
      While this wasn't necessarily in the realm of design, it got me thinking
      some more about how a platform like this can extend to something like design.

<h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>
<p>Some honorable mentions that helped me along with my research were <a href="https://peopleofcraft.com/">
  People of Craft</a>, which is an initiative that showcases 'creatives of color'.
  It's message is to 'redefine what creative looks like', tying back to my interest
  in how the roots of design include people of color.</p>

  <img src="../images/28blacks.jpg" alt="28blacks" width="50%" height="50%">
  <p><a href="http://28blacks.com/">28 Days of Black Designers</a> is self-explanatory,
    though I'd like to point out that their site is very minimalistic, but it seems
    to utilize JS very nicely. When hovering over the numbers, another circle
    slides on over with the name of a black designer and their work title. When you
    click on the number, it'll bring you over onto their page with an interview
    with the designer and their work. This is a great platform that promotes black
    designers, and helped me think about ways I can incorporate showcasing the
    works of others, while still conveying an important message about diversity
    in design.
